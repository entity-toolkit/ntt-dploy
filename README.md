## Deployment scripts for the `Entity`

This tool helps you set up an environment to run the `Entity` code by building & installing all the dependencies and setting up the environment variables. To use this tool, you need [environment modules](https://modules.sourceforge.net/) with the proper compilers (e.g., `gcc`, `nvcc`, etc.).

### Usage

There are two options to use this tool:

1. If you are using `go` simply install it with `go install -v github.com/entity-toolkit/ntt-dploy`, and run `ntt-dploy`.
2. Download the appropriate pre-build binary from the latest release and run it directly.
